# To Do

- Proper Errors
- Security Checks (owners of tokens, ..)
- More than one market (Multiple asset, multiple collateralization ratio)
- Fee
- Cranker reward
- Liquidation mechanism (if there's a crash, now it's pyth, in future should allow custom quote price or separate instruction to allow loss)
- Test setup is following user journeys and understanding one test is hard separately, a better testing suite would help

- Timed or timed order markets/order rematch
